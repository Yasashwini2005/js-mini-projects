📝 To-Do + Weather App

A responsive frontend project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript combining two core web features:
- A To-Do List with persistent data using `localStorage`
- A Weather App that fetches real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API

This project demonstrates practical use of DOM manipulation, Fetch API, asynchronous programming, and responsive layouts (Flexbox + Grid)— making it a perfect showcase for core frontend skills.
